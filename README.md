##  Lesson 1: HTML - (HyperText Markup Language) - Opening Tags
Let's dive into the wonderful world of HTML! It's like building with LEGO blocks, but on the computer. We use elements to create webpages, one piece at a time. And guess what? Elements are made using special tags!

Tags look like signs with a less than < and a greater than > symbol. We have two kinds of tags: opening tags and closing tags. Today, we'll focus on opening tags.

Now, let's have some fun and create our first element together! Imagine we want to make a dog element. All you need to do is write the word "dog" between those special signs, like this: `<dog>`. Ta-da! You've made a dog element!
