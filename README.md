# Coding for kids level 0
##  Lesson 1: HTML - (HyperText Markup Language) - Closing Tags
Welcome back to our coding adventure! In our last lesson, we learned all about opening tags and how they are the first step in creating elements for our webpages. Today, we'll continue our journey and discover the magical world of closing tags!

Just like opening tags, closing tags are special codes that help us create complete elements. They have a similar shape, with a less than < and a greater than > symbol, but they also have a forward slash / in between. Closing tags are like the final puzzle piece that completes our element.

Let's imagine we want to create a cat element. We start with the opening tag <cat>, just like we did before. But this time, we need to add the closing tag to finish it off. So we write </cat>. Look at how the forward slash makes it a closing tag!

Now, the computer knows that everything between the opening tag and the closing tag belongs to the cat element. It's like putting our cat element in a special box.

#### Exercise 01

<p>
Instructions: Get your pencils and paper ready again because it's time to create more amazing elements! This time, you'll need to use both opening and closing tags to make complete elements. Let your imagination run wild and create unique elements. Here are some examples to inspire you:

```html
<dog></dog>
<flower></flower>
<car></car>
...
<tree></tree>
```
#### Exercise 02

Instructions: Let's have another exciting puzzle challenge! Take a look at the following items and figure out which ones are complete elements. Remember, complete elements have both an opening and a closing tag. Are you ready to spot the correct ones? Let's go!

```html
1. <apple></apple>
2. <water></water
3. chicken></chicken>
4. <fish></fish<
5. >house></house<
6. <></>
