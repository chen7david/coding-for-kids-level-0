# Coding for kids level 0

##  Introduction
Have you ever been to a website? Websites are made using special languages called HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is like the building blocks of a website, but it doesn't look very pretty on its own. That's where CSS comes in! It helps make websites look nice and colorful, like adding colors and fancy designs. And then there's JavaScript! It's like the magic that makes websites do cool things when you click on them. It's what makes websites interactive and fun! In this course, we'll be learning all about these three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Get ready to create amazing websites!

##  HTML - (HyperText Markup Language)
#### Opening Elements
Let's dive into the wonderful world of HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language! It's like building with colorful LEGO blocks. Just as you connect LEGO pieces, we use small blocks called elements to create websites, one piece at a time. The first thing we'll learn is about elements. They have a special shape with a sign that looks like a less than < and a greater than > symbol.

Now, let's have some fun and create a dog element together! All you need to do is write the word "dog" between those special signs, and presto, you've made a dog element! Look at the example below:
```html
<dog>
```
##### Exercise 001
Instructions: Get your favorite colored pencils and a piece of paper ready because it's time to create your very own special elements! Let's see some fun examples to inspire you:
Remember, these are just examples. Let your imagination run wild and create your own unique elements. Have fun exploring the world of creativity with your pencil and paper!
```html

```

##### Exercise 002
